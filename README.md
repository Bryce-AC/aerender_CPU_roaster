# aerender_CPU_roaster
Some cobbled together batch scripting to run multiple instances of aerender

## Instructions
1. Make sure there's a composition in the AE project called `render` which has been added to the render queue with the settings you desire
2. Run the batch file (in the same folder as the aep file preferably)
4. Run it and it'll produce two folders in the same directory as the batch file, run the new batch files in the `render_scripts` folder
5. Profit
